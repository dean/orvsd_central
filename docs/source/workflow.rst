Orvsd_Cenral Development Workflow
=================================

The Workflow for Orvsd Central 
------------------------------
When developing TheOC please follow this general workflow (details provided
below the numbered list)

1. Create Issues.

    * When an issue arises create an issue for it 
    * When a feature needs to be developed create an issue for it
    * Do not work on anything that will eventually be pushed to production
      unless there is an issue create before work begins

2. Make Branches for each issue
    
    * Unless expressly specified one should always branch from the `develop`
      branch.
    * Once you have created an appropriate issue on either GitHub or Code.O.O
      for ORVSD Central or the Moodle Plugins respectively.
    * When creating a new branch in orvsd_central please follow `these
      guidelines <./tranching.html>`_. [descriptive_name-<issue #>]
    * Refer to `these docs <./plugins.html>`_ for specific branching syntax to
      plugins. `[<moodle version>/<feature or bug>/<issue #>_optional_descriptive_name]`

3. Assign individuals to each issue

    * Once you have created an issue make sure to assign it to one of the
      developers on the project who can best resolve the issue. If you yourself
      can handle the issue assign yourself.
    * Contact whoever you have assigned to the issue in the dev irc channel so
      they know they have been assigned the issue.
      

4. Review regularly

    * Projects should be reviewed from the planning stages onward 
    * Before beginning a project be sure to have your plan reviewed by the one
      of your peers.
