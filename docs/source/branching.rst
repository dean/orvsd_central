Branching
=========

Branching Naming Scheme
-----------------------

The basic branching naming scheme for ORVSD Central on GitHub is as follows:

`desriptive_issue_title-issue#`

Example
-------

Say you need to create a branch to resolve `issue #97: Submit Button Disapears
on Page Reload` (for example). The branch name would look like this:

`submit_button_fix-97`

The descriptive title should be short, but also summarize the issue at hand.
This is so someone looking at the list of branches can determine the purpose of
a branch without having to look at the list of issues.
