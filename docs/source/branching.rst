Branching

Branching Naming Scheme
-----------------------

The basic branch naming scheme ORVSD Central branching on GitHub is as follows:

`desriptive_issue_title-issue#`

Example
-------

Say you need to create a branch to resolve `issue #97: Submit Button Disapears
on Page Reload` (for example). The branch name would look like this:

`submit_button_fix-97`

The descriptive title should be short but also summarize the issue at hand
so someone looking at the list of branches can figure out what the branch is
for without having to look at the list of issues.
